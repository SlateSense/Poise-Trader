   INITIAL_CAPITAL=100
   MAX_POSITION_SIZE=10

   ```bash
   python start_bot.py
   ```

3. **Monitor for 24-48 hours** to ensure live execution works correctly

### Phase 2: Gradual Scale-Up
1. **If Phase 1 successful,** increase capital to $500-1000
2. **Monitor performance** for 1 week
3. **Adjust position sizes** and risk parameters based on results
4. **Scale up gradually** as confidence builds

### Phase 3: Full Production

2. **Enable all strategies** and advanced features
3. **Set up monitoring dashboards**
4. **Implement automated alerts**
